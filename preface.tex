\section*{Preface}

These notes are the ever-growing result of my interest in category theory and polynomial functors. All I know about these two things I owe to Joachim Kock and his wise guidance. Refer to his \emph{Notes on Polynomial Functors} \cite{kock} for a much more extensive overview of the main subject of these. I also perused Tom Leinster's \emph{Basic Category Theory} \cite{leinster} for foundations on the broader subject, and Emily Riehl's \emph{Category Theory in Context} \cite{riehl} for the context I severely lack.
