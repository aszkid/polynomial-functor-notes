\subsection{Multivariate polynomials}

We are ready to introduce polynomial functors in their fullest generality. Given a set-valued function $p:E\to B$, we define a few functors that, composed, will entirely characterize a polynomial functor. We want to multiple variables, and the standard strategy is to have an indexing function $E\to I$ so that each fibre $E_b$ is split into different labels.

To begin with, let $p^*:\slice{\catset}{I}$
